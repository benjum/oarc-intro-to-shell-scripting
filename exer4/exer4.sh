#!/bin/bash

for f in *.txt
do
	cat $f > all.txt
done

# You will get an error running this. Why? Improve the script so the error does not occur.

# The script-writer likely wanted this script to write all the file contents to "all.txt".  Is this what happens? And can the script be altered for improved results?
