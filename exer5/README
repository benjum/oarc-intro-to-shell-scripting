1. Use a for loop to iterate over each line of animal_data.txt, count the number of characters, and output the data into a file.

2. If you think you can accomplish the same thing using a pipe instead of a for loop, try it and see what happens.

2. Use another for loop to iterate over this new data file, and use an if statement to print out one statement when the number is greater than 17, and a different statement when it's smaller than 17.
